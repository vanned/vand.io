Hackathon Idea
============


* Create a web app / mobile app that allows a company or organization in the private
or public sector to upload information regarding an attack on their network/hosts.
* Anonymously allow the sharing of the information while still maintaining the verification
of the origin of the data.
* Create a system to redact sensitive data from the information uploaded.
* Setup a "sharing" system to share information with certain or all companies.
* Allow "hacker" organization(s) or profile(s) to tie events to them.


Example
------------

Google wants to sign up for the site, they provide a coordinator from their company
to upload information on their websites behalf. They reach out to our site and provide
information that verifies who they say they are. They are now labeled Company A.
Company A wants to provide information on a DDOS attack that they have witnessed.
They either redact the information ahead of time or upload it under the impression that
the website will redact it for them. The coordinator gathers the information including but
not limited to packet tracing, event logs, system logs, disk image files, malware binaries,
instructions for mitigation, signatures for anti-virus, signatures for IDS/IPS systems,
software versions, and any forensic analysis or reconnaissance done.
